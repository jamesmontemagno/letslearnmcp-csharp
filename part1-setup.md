> **Navigation**: [← Back to Overview](README.md) | [Next: Part 2 - Monkey App →](part2-monkey-app.md)

## What You'll Need
Before diving into MCP development, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### 1. Visual Studio Code
- Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Essential for MCP development and integration

### 2. .NET 9 SDK
- Install the latest [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- Verify installation: `dotnet --version`

### 3. C# Dev Kit Extension
- Install the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension
- Provides comprehensive C# development support
- Includes IntelliSense, debugging, and project templates

### 4. Understanding MCP
- What is Model Context Protocol?
- How MCP Servers work with AI assistants
- The client-server architecture
- Use cases and benefits

## Environment Verification
- [ ] VS Code installed and running
- [ ] .NET 9 SDK installed
- [ ] C# Dev Kit extension active
- [ ] Basic understanding of MCP concepts

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely access and interact with external tools, data sources, and services. Think of it as a bridge that allows AI models like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude to:

- **Access Real-time Data**: Connect to databases, APIs, and live data sources
- **Execute Actions**: Perform operations like creating files, sending emails, or managing systems
- **Extend Capabilities**: Add custom functionality specific to your needs
- **Maintain Security**: Control what the AI can and cannot access

### Key Benefits for C# Developers

1. **Familiar Technology Stack**: Use your existing C# skills and .NET ecosystem
2. **Rich Tooling**: Leverage Visual Studio Code and C# Dev Kit for development
3. **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in support for dependency injection, logging, and async patterns
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with compile-time validation
5. **Performance**: Optimized JSON serialization with source generators

```

### Use Cases

- **Data Analysis**: Connect AI to your databases and analytics systems
- **Automation**: Let AI assistants manage your development workflows
- **Documentation**: Generate and update documentation from live code
- **Testing**: Create and run tests based on AI analysis
- **Deployment**: Automate deployment processes with AI guidance
